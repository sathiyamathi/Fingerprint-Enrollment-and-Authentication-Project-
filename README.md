# Fingerprint Enrollment and Authentication using R307 Fingerprint Sensor

This project demonstrates a comprehensive fingerprint enrollment and authentication system utilizing the R307 fingerprint sensor, Arduino, and C++. The system allows users to enroll their fingerprints and authenticate their identity by matching their fingerprints against the stored templates. Additionally, the project includes functionality to display the fingerprint template extracted from the user. The implementation covers the integration of the R307 sensor with Arduino, efficient handling of fingerprint data, and secure authentication protocols, providing a robust solution for biometric security applications. Detailed documentation and code examples are provided to facilitate easy setup and customization.
